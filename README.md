## Hi there 👋

# Hi there, I'm Affaan Irshad! 👋
### Aspiring SOC Analyst | Cloud Security Enthusiast | 

I bridge the gap between technical security operations and business value. As a recent **Bachelor of Cybersecurity** graduate, I specialize in building practical cloud security labs (SIEM/SOAR) to understand the real-world threats organizations face today.

I am currently seeking opportunities in **SOC Analyst Roles** and **Cyber Security Sales**, where I can leverage my technical background to solve complex customer problems.
