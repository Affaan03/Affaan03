# Hi there, I'm Affaan Irshad! 👋
### Aspiring SOC Analyst | Cloud Security Enthusiast | 

I bridge the gap between technical security operations and business value. As a recent **Bachelor of Cybersecurity** graduate, I specialize in building practical cloud security labs (SIEM/SOAR) to understand the real-world threats organizations face today.

I am currently seeking opportunities in **SOC Analyst Roles** and **Cyber Security Sales**, where I can leverage my technical background to solve complex customer problems.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔹 [1. Automated Malware Defense & SOAR (Wazuh)](https://github.com/Affaan03/Automated-Malware-Detection-Response-with-Wazuh)
*Engineered a defensive pipeline to simulate and neutralize live ransomware. Integrated VirusTotal for hash enrichment and configured "Active Response" to automatically isolate infected endpoints.*
* **Tech:** Wazuh XDR, VirusTotal API, Active Response (Firewall-Drop), Wireshark.
* **Outcome:** Achieved sub-second automated containment of malicious payloads, preventing lateral movement.

### 🔹 [2. Azure Sentinel & SOAR Automation](https://github.com/Affaan03/Azure-Cloud-Honeypot-Global-Threat-Intelligence-SIEM.git)
*Built a live "Honeypot" in the cloud to attract attackers, mapped their locations in real-time, and created an automated response system.*
* **Tech:** Azure Sentinel, Logic Apps, PowerShell, KQL.
* **Outcome:** Reduced incident response time by 90% via automated email alerts.

### 🔹 [3. Enterprise Vulnerability Management & SIEM Detection](https://github.com/Affaan03/Enterprise-Vulnerability-Management-SIEM-Detection-Guide)
*Designed a "Red vs. Blue" simulation to identify and detect internal network lateral movement. Deployed Sysmon to bridge the visibility gap in default Windows logging and engineered custom Wazuh rules.*
* **Tech:** Wazuh SIEM, Sysmon, Nmap, MITRE ATT&CK, XML Rule Tuning.
* **Outcome:** Transformed invisible network scans into Critical Severity alerts by mapping custom logic to MITRE T1021.002 (Remote Services).
